Regular tables
==============

Normal tables in RST can be obtained by simply "drawing" their structure with a combination of symbols, as in the following code snippet (it's easier seen than explained!).

A row of equal signs separates the first row from the rest, if you want it to be the label of your table. 

This type of tables is well rendered in the PDF output.

   | 1    | Puss in Boots |
   +------+---------------+
   | 2    | Cinderella    |
