# Tables With Sphinx: A Quick Tutorial


This is a simple tutorial on how to obtain tables with Sphinx that look good both in the HTML page and on the PDF output. It is more a bunch of notes to my future self than a real tutorial, but I hope it can be of use to you as well.

The tutorial is available here: http://tables-with-sphinx.readthedocs.io/
